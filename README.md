## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup for structure.
- CSS custom properties for styling.
- Flexbox for layout.
- Media queries for responsive design.

### What I Learned

I learned how to import icons into my project using "Remixicon". Here's the CDN link for Remixicon. It's a bit long, but you don't need to memorize it!

```html
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/remixicon/4.6.0/remixicon.css" integrity="sha512-kJlvECunwXftkPwyvHbclArO8wszgBGisiLeuDFwNM8ws+wKIw0sv1os3ClWZOcrEB2eRXULYUsm8OVRGJKwGA==" crossorigin="anonymous" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" />
```

After that, we can use icons like HTML text. That's really cool!

If you want more help with writing markdown, I recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

## Continued Development

In the future, I would like to add light and dark mode functionality.

## Useful Resources

- [Remixicon](https://remixicon.com/) - This helped me with importing icons into my project. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - This helped me with importing fonts into my project.
